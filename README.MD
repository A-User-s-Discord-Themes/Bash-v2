## Installing
You need to install a mod client before installing the theme. We recomend installing [Powercord](https://powercord.dev/)

### Powercord
Open your favourite terminal and type:
```sh
cd [powercordDir]/src/Powercord/themes
git clone https://github.com/A-User-s-Discord-Themes/Bash-v2
```
###### (Replace [powercordDir] with the directory where Powercord is installed)
Then restart Discord by pressing `Ctrl` + `R`

### BetterDiscord
Download the file here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/A-User-s-Discord-Themes/Bash-v2/master/bash.theme.css
Then drop it in the themes folder
###### (Having trouble to install? [Check this guide](https://0x71.cc/bd/troubleshoot/))

#### Glasscord and BetterDiscord
We recomend using Glasscord with **Powercord**, because Powercord has useful classes that determinates to themes some useful states (like if the window is maximized), and one of these is if Glasscord is installed. Using Bash with Glasscord and BetterDiscord may cause rendering issues, specifically with Bash blur effects
